# Olist Customer Retention Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer retention and revenue trends for the Olist e-commerce dataset.

The goal is to evaluate:
- Customer repeat purchase behavior
- Cohort retention over time
- Revenue growth patterns
- Business sustainability

---

## Key Findings

- Only 7.5% of customers made more than one purchase.
- Retention drops significantly after the first month.
- Revenue shows an upward trend over time.
- Growth appears to be driven mainly by new customer acquisition rather than repeat purchases.

---

## Business Implications

The business model currently depends heavily on continuous customer acquisition.
Low retention may pose a risk to long-term sustainability if acquisition costs increase.

## Tools Used

- SQL
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
